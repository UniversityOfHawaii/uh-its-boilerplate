Styling and layout for UH Groupings

You can find color variables in variables.css
This uses the var() Function. https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_variables.asp

Unneeded styles have been removed and instead replaced with Bootstrap classes where applicable (especially margins, padding, buttons).

Some Bootstrap styles have been overridden so that you can continue to use the same classes. Usually this just replaces a color or background color (e.g., btn-primary).
