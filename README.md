Styling and layout for UH ITS Applications and Websites

You can find color variables in variables.css
This uses the var() Function. https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_variables.asp

Use Bootstrap classes for margins, padding, buttons, etc. instead of adding unneeded styling.

Some Bootstrap styles have been overridden so that you can continue to use the same classes. Usually this just replaces a color or background color (e.g., btn-primary).
